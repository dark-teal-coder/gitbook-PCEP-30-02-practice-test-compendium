## PCEP-30-02 FAQs

**How do I take the PCEP-30-02 exam via OpenEDG Testing Service?**

OpenEDG Python Institute Test Candidates can register and take the PCEP exam online via the OpenEDG Testing Service Platform available at [https://edube.org](https://edube.org).

OpenEDG Python Institute PCEP exam sessions (default, non-proctored global standard of test delivery) do not need to be scheduled in advance, and test candidates can register for and take exams on the same day.

**Create an account:** Prior to taking an exam, the candidate is required to create a User Account (Test Candidate Account) at [https://edube.org/registration](https://edube.org/registration). The candidate must provide their personal information and address, set up a secure password, and read and accept the Terms of Service.

**Purchase a voucher:** To purchase an exam voucher, the test candidate should go to [https://ums.edube.org/store](https://ums.edube.org/store?q=pcep-30-02), add the voucher to the cart, and place an order.

**Assign a voucher:** Test candidates who already have an exam voucher can assign it to their User Account before taking the exam. The exam vouchers assigned are displayed on the OpenEDG User Account and may be used to launch exams via OpenEDG Testing Service.

**Take an exam:** After logging in at [https://edube.org/login](https://edube.org/login), test candidates can launch exam sessions by:

* clicking Take Exam (if the test candidate has an exam voucher and wishes to begin their exam session immediately) or by
* clicking Launch Exam next to the voucher assigned to the OpenEDG User Account (if the voucher has been assigned to the account.)

**What if I have a problem with my exam appointment/session?**

Contact OpenEDG Support (support@openedg.org), provide your exam session number/voucher code, and describe your issue.

**How do I reschedule or cancel an exam online?**

If you wish to reschedule your proctored exam, you must contact the OpenEDG Testing Service Provider/facility you will take your test at not less than 24 hours prior to your exam appointment.

Non-Proctored exams do not need to be rescheduled. As long as you have not redeemed your exam voucher, you can take your exam in a later time. Please make sure the voucher code has not expired.

If you wish to cancel your proctored exam, you must contact the OpenEDG Testing Service Provider/facility you will take your test at not less than 24 hours prior to your exam appointment.

**Will I receive diagnostic information about my performance after taking an online exam?**

Yes, a score report. The score report provides feedback on how you scored in each content area.

**Can I still take my exam via OpenEDG Testing Service if my system does not pass the system diagnostic test?**

No. You should not register for OpenEDG Testing Service exam delivery if your system does not pass the system test.

**After my exam has launched at an OpenEDG Testing Center (physical facility) and I am assigned a proctor, how long do I have to complete the exam?**

You will have the same amount of time to complete the exam as you would when taking the exam via OpenEDG Testing Service (online).

**Is the PCEP-30-02 exam delivered via OpenEDG Testing Service (online/non-proctored) more difficult or easier than the PCEP-30-02 exam delivered at OpenEDG Testing Centers (on-campus/proctored)?**

No. The exams are identical.

If I have technical issues before, during, or after exam administration, who do I contact?

If you encounter a technical issue during exam delivery, please use the OpenEDG Support Service links to contact the OpenEDG Support Team, or contact the exam proctor who will help you try to resolve the issue. If necessary, the proctor provides an Incident Report number to reference when following up with OpenEDG Customer Support.
