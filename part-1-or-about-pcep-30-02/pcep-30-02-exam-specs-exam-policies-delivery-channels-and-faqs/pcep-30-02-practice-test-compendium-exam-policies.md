# PCEP-30-02 Practice Test Compendium – Exam Policies

## PCEP-30-02 Exam Delivery Channels

The entry-level certification exam (PCEP-30-02) is administered worldwide both in proctored and \*non-proctored formats. **The non-proctored exam mode is the default global exam format** offered to test candidates through the OpenEDG Testing Service, an online exam delivery service owned, run, and managed by the Open Education and Development Group.

The proctored mode, which is a non-default exam delivery format, is available to schools, colleges, and universities, as well as certain organizations and institutions participating in the OpenEDG Education Partner Program.

&#x20; **Note**

If you are an individual looking to take a PCEP-30-02 exam, you will most likely **choose the non-proctored option for the exam**. If you are about to take the exam as part of your school’s or company’s group testing initiative, please ask your local exam coordinator for more information about the format of your exam.

\*By non-proctored we mean that there is no real-time exam supervision or invigilation performed by a human. However, the OpenEDG Testing Service, which is the default exam delivery engine for the Python Institute entry-level exams, employs a number of in-session auto-proctoring, monitoring, and analytical tools that are used to ensure the security, integrity, and confidentiality of the exam. The AI monitors the exam session, checks for any non-standard events, and marks those session logs that indicate signs of deviation. These exam sessions are then manually reviewed by the Exam Review Team, who decides upon the final status of the exam.

## Exam registration, admission, process

When you are ready to take the exam, make sure that your testing environment is quiet, well-lighted, and free from any noise or distraction. The standard, non-proctored exam does not have to be scheduled in advance, as it is available through the OpenEDG Testing Service in the _Test-Now™_ format, as part of your OpenEDG web account functionality. To take the exam:

* First, you need an exam voucher that will let you launch the exam session. If you don’t have a voucher yet, you can purchase one in the [OpenEDG Voucher Store](https://ums.edube.org/store?q=pcep-30-02) (look for the PCEP-30-02 exam).
* Second, you should familiarize yourself with the [PCEP Testing Policies](https://pythoninstitute.org/pcep-testing-policies/), to make sure you meet the minimum technical requirements, understand the exam procedure, and follow the code of conduct.
* Finally, you must [sign in to your OpenEDG web account](https://edube.org/login), click the _Certify_ tab, and enter your voucher code. Then click _Launch_, complete the admission process, and begin your session. If you don’t have an OpenEDG web account yet, you will need to [create one](https://edube.org/registration).

Please note that once your account has been set up, **you will no longer be able to edit some of the information associated with your profile** (i.e., your name, email address, and date of birth), so please make sure all the details you provide in the registration form are correct. Requests for changes in personal details can be submitted by contacting OpenEDG Customer Service through your OpenEDG User Account Inbox.

## Non-Proctored Exams

Test Candidates who wish to take a non-proctored exam do not need a proctor authorization, which means their exam session begins immediately with no supervision after they enter the voucher code and proceed to the exam session on their User Account.

Candidates who have an exam voucher should sign in to their User Account at [https://edube.org/login](https://edube.org/login), and enter the voucher code. Then they will be asked to read and accept the Non-Disclosure Agreement and OpenEDG Testing Service Terms and Conditions, and begin the exam session.

## Proctored Exams

Test Candidates who wish to take a proctored exam need a proctor authorization to begin the exam session. Candidates can take proctored exams at OpenEDG Testing Service facilities (i.e., schools and universities that are members of the OpenEDG Authorized Academy Program and/or OpenEDG Testing Service Partners).

Proctored exams must be held in a secure testing environment (physical test center, quiet testing room, testing station which complies with recommended hardware/software, proctor invigilation during exam session, etc.).

A designated proctor must verify the candidate’s identity and exam information, and approve the launch of the exam session. During the exam, the proctor will supervise the session and report any improper conduct or examination process violation to the exam sponsor.

We ask that you arrive at the testing center at least 15 minutes before your scheduled appointment time so that you have time to complete the necessary sign-in procedures.

Please be prepared to show at least one form of personal identification, e.g., a valid, government-issued picture ID. Expired IDs are not valid. Failure to provide the required ID will result in you being denied entry to the examination. Your exam Proctor will verify your identity and launch your exam session.

You can provide the following forms of ID: State/Country ID card; Government-issued driver’s license; Passport; Military ID; Employee/school ID, Social Security card; Credit/Debit Card; Bank/ATM card; Library card.

## Non-Disclosure Agreement

Test Candidates must read and accept the Non-Disclosure Agreement, which takes effect immediately after launching the exam session. Test Candidates agree to treat examination materials as confidential, take no copy of the test or notes that contain the content of the exam, specifically the exam questions and answers used during the session, and comply with the Testing Policies throughout and after the exam session.

Refusal to accept the Non-Disclosure Agreement will result in termination of the exam session – the voucher status will be changed to used, and the exam fee will be forfeited.

## Retake Policy

When a candidate fails an exam, he or she must **wait 7 days before being allowed to re-sit that exam** (paid option). There is no limit to the number of retakes of a failed exam.
