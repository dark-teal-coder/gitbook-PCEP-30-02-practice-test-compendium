# 1.2.1.3 PCEP Practice Test Compendium – Python basic types and literals

## **Python basic types and literals: continued**

1. **String** literals are sequences (including empty ones) of characters (digits, letters, punctuation marks, etc.). There are two kinds of string literal:
   * **single-line**, when the string itself begins and ends in the same line of code: these literals are enclosed in a pair of `'` (apostrophe) or `"` (quote) marks.
   * **multi-line**, when the string may extend to more than one line of code: these literals are enclosed in a pair of trigraphs either `"""` or `'''`
   * strings enclosed inside apostrophes can contain quotes, and vice versa.
   * if you need to put an apostrophe inside an apostrophe-limited string, or a quote inside a quote-limited string, you must precede them with the \ (backslash) sign, which acts as an escape character (a character which changes the meaning of the character that follows it); some of the most used escape sequences are:
     * `\\` – backslash
     * `\'` – apostrophe
     * `\"` – quote
     * `\n` – newline character
     * `\r` – carriage return character
     * `\t` – horizontal tab character
2. Here are some examples of correct string literals:
   * `"Hello world"`
   * `'Goodbye!'`
   * `''` (an empty string)
   * `"Python's den"`
   * `'Python\'s den'`
   * `"""Two` \
     `lines"""`
3. **Boolean literals** denote **the only two possible values** used by the _Boolean algebra_ – their only acceptable denotations are `True` and `False`.
4. The `None` literal denotes an **empty value** and can be used to indicate that a certain item contains no usable value.
