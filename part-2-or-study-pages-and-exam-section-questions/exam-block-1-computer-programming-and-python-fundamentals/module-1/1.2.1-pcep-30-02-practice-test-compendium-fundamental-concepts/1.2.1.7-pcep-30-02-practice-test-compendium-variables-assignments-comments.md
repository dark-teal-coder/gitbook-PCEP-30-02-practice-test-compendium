## Compound operators

### **Compound Arithmetic Operators**

| Operator                  | Meaning                               | Example                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `variable += expression`  | `variable = variable + (expression)`  | `counter += 1`              |
| `variable -= expression`  | `variable = variable - (expression)`  | `due -= ret`                |
| `variable *= expression`  | `variable = variable * (expression)`  | `next_power *= next_power`  |
| `variable /= expression`  | `variable = variable / (expression)`  | `fraction /= fraction`      |
| `variable //= expression` | `variable = variable // (expression)` | `always_one //= always_one` |
| `variable %= expression`  | `variable = variable % (expression)`  | `always_zero %= 1`          |
| `variable **= expression` | `variable = variable ** (expression)` | `square_me **= 2`           |

### **Compound String Operators**

| Operator                 | Meaning                              | Example            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| `variable += expression` | `variable = variable + (expression)` | `header += '****'` |
| `variable *= expression` | `variable = variable * (expression)` | `doubled *= 2`     |

Note: Boolean operators have no short-cut variants.

## Comments

01\) A part of the code line which starts with hash (`#`), which is not a part of a string literal, is considered a **comment** (a part of the code which is ignored by the interpreter)

For example, these two lines contain comments:

```python
# This is a line which is completely ignored by the Python interpreter.
result = True # only part of this line is a comment
```
