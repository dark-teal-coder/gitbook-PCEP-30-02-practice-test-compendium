# 1.2.1.1 PCEP-30-02 Practice Test Compendium – Lists and strings

## Lists

1. A **list** is a data aggregate that contains a certain number (including zero) of elements of any type.
2. \

3. Lists are **sequences** – they can be iterated, and the order of the elements is established.
4. \

5. Lists are **mutable** – their contents may be changed.
6. \

7. Lists can be **initialized** with list literals. For example, these two assignments instantiate two lists – the former is empty, while the latter contains three elements:\
   \
   `empty_list = []three_elements = [1, 'two', False]`\

8. The number of elements contained in the list can be determined by the `len()` function. For example, the following snippet prints `3` to the screen:\
   \
   `print(len(['a', 'b', 'c'])`\

9. Any of the list's elements can be accessed using **indexing**. List elements are indexed by integer numbers starting from **zero**. Therefore, the first list element's index is **0** while the last element's index is equal to the **list length minus 1**. Using indices that are not integers raises the `TypeError` exception. For example, the following snippet prints `a b c 0 1 2` to the screen:\
   \
   `the_list = ['a', 'b', 'c']counter = 0for ix in range(len(the_list)):print(the_list[ix], end=' ')the_list[ix] = countercounter += 1for ix in range(len(the_list)):print(the_list[ix], end=' ')`
10. `The list elements can be indexed with`` `**`negative numbers`**`, too. In this case,`` `**`-1`**` ``accesses the last element of the list, and`` `**`-2`**` ``accesses the one before the last, and so on. The alternative first list element's index is -len(list).`\
