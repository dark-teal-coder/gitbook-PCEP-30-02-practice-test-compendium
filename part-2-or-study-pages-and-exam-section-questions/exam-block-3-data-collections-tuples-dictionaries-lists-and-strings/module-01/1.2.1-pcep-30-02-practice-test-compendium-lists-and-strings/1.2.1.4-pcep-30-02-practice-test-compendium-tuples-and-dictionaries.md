# 1.2.1.4 PCEP-30-02 Practice Test Compendium – Tuples and dictionaries

## Dictionaries – continued

Accessing a dictionary's value requires the use of its key. For example, the following line outputs `911` to the screen:

`print(phone_directory['Emergency'])`

An attempt to access an element whose key is absent in the dictionary raises the `KeyError` exception.

The `in` and `not` in operators can be used to check whether a certain key exists in the dictionary. For example, the following line prints `True False` to the screen:

`print('Emergency' in phone_directory, 'White House' in phone_directory)`

The `len()` function returns the **number of pairs** contained in the directory. For example, the following line outputs `0` to the screen:

`print(len(empty_directory))`

**Changing** a value of the existing key is done by an **assignment**. For example, the following snippet outputs `False` to the screen:

`attendance = {'Bob': True}attendance['Bob'] = Falseprint(attendance['Bob'])`

**Adding** a new pair to the dictionary resembles a regular assignment. For example, the following snippet outputs `2` to the screen:

`domains = {'au': 'Australia'}domains['at'] = 'Austria'print(len(domains))`

**Removing** a pair from a dictionary is done with the `del` instruction. For example, the following snippet outputs `0` to the screen:

`currencies = {'USD': 'United States dollar'}del currencies['USD']print(len(currencies))`

When iterated through by the for loop, the dictionary **displays only its keys**. For example, the following snippet outputs `A B` to the screen:

`phonetic = {'A': 'Alpha', 'B': 'Bravo'}for key in phonetic:print(key, end=' ')`

The `.keys()` method returns a **list of keys** contained in the dictionary. For example, the following snippet outputs `A B` to the screen:

`phonetic = {'A': 'Alpha', 'B': 'Bravo'}for key in phonetic.keys():print(key, end=' ')`

The `.values()` method returns a list of values contained in the dictionary. For example, the following snippet outputs `Alpha Bravo` to the screen:

`phonetic = {'A': 'Alpha', 'B': 'Bravo'}for value in phonetic.values():print(value, end=' ')`

The `.items()` method returns a **list of two-element** tuples, each filled with **key:value** pairs. For example, the following snippet outputs `('A', 'Alpha') ('B', 'Bravo')` to the screen:\
`phonetic = {'A': 'Alpha', 'B': 'Bravo'}for item in phonetic.items():print(item, end=' ')`
