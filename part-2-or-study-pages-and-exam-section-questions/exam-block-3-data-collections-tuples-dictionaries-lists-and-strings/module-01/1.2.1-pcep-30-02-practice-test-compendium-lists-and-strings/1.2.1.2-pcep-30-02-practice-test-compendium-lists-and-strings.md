# 1.2.1.2 PCEP-30-02 Practice Test Compendium â€“ Lists and strings

## Lists and strings

If any of the slice's indices exceeds the allowable range, **no exception is raised**, and the non-existent elements are not taken into consideration. Therefore, it is possible that the resulting slice is an **empty** list.

Assigning a list to a list **does not copy elements**. Such an assignment results in a situation when more than one name identifies the same data aggregate.

For example, the following snippet prints `True` to the screen:

`list_a = [1]list_b = list_alist_b[0] = 0print(list_a[0] == list_b[0])`

As the slice is a copy of the source list, the following snippet prints `False` to the screen:

`list_a = [1]list_b = list_a[:]list_b[0] = 0print(list_a[0] == list_b[0])`

The `.append(element)` method can be used to **append an element** to the end of an existing list.

For example, the following snippet outputs `[1]` to the screen:

`the_list = []the_list.append(1)print(the_list)`

The `.insert(at_index, element)` method can be used to **insert** the element at the `at_index` of the existing list. For example, the following snippet outputs `[2, 1]` to the screen:

`the_list = [1]the_list.insert(0, 2)print(the_list)`

The `del the_list[index]` instruction can be used to **remove** any of the existing list elements.

For example, the following snippet prints `[]` to the screen:

`the_list = [1]del the_list[0]print(the_list)`

The `in` and `not` in operators can check whether any value is contained inside the list or not. For example, the following snippet prints `True False` to the screen:

`the_list = [1, 'a']print('a' in the_list, 1 not in the_list)`

Lists can be **iterated through** (traversed) by the `for` loop, which allows the programmer to scan all their elements without the use of explicit indexing. For example, the following snippet prints `1 2 3` to the screen:

`the_list = [1,2,3]for element in the_list:print(element, end=' ')`

**List comprehension** allows the programmer to construct lists in a compact way. For example, the following snippet prints `[1,2,3]` to the screen:

`the_list = [x for x in range(1,4)]print(the_list)`

**Strings**, like lists, are sequences, and in many contexts they behave like lists, especially when they are indexed and sliced or are arguments of the `len()` function.

The `in` and `not` in operators can be applied to strings to check if any string is a **part of another string**. An empty string is considered a part of any string, including an empty one.

Strings are **immutable** and their contents cannot be changed.
